      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Software Development student, in the midst of a career change. I am currently learning Full-Stack Web-Development and this field is very fascinating to me. I like the idea of solving real user problems with
        practical solutions. Moreover, I am always eager to learn and I like to understand systems thoroughly, so that I get the big picture. </p>
        <p>My previous experience as a veterinarian helped me develop many skills, such as resilience to overcome critical situations as well as dealing with stress, difficult costumers and many times the need to think
        outside of the box. I also learned the need of continuing education to keep me up to date.</p>
